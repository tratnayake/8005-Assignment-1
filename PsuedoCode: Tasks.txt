PsuedoCode: Tasks

//threadObject structure
threadObject= {Name of the thread: "Thread1", Number of iterations: number of times to hash}

Main(number of processes, number of iterations){
	
	- Write to main log file the starting time.

	- Create the thread objects that contain name of thread, and number of iterations.

	- Create the threads, arguments to do runTask and supply the thread object.

	- join each thread to make sure that the program waits till they finish.
	
	- Write to main log file timestamp once all threads completed.
	
}

run the task(threadObject){

	- do a sched yield to make sure that we yield to other processes once this one finishes.

	- lock resources to execute thread.


	print to main log file that task has started
	print to individual log file that task has started

	(loop from 0 - number of iterations){

		plaintext = Concatenate "HASHSTRING"+IterationNumber";
		Hashtext = Hash(plaintext);
		write Hashtext to individual logfile.

	}

	print to individual log file that task has finished.
	print to main log file that task has finished.

	- unlock resources
